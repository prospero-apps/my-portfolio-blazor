# My Portfolio

My Portfolio is a Blazor WebAssembly app that runs exclusively in the browser, so no server is required. Instead of a backend and a database, I use data stored in a file. This will do for our purposes because there isnâ€™t going to be much data.

I have a 6-part series on my Prospero Coder blog where I demonstrate how build this app from scratch. You will find it here: https://prosperocoder.com/blog/blazor/

This app is hosted as a Static Web App on Azure. It presents my most important projects in a couple categories, like web projects, games, Blender projects, books (the ones I've written myself), online courses (the ones I created) and magazines (I also tried issuing some magazines). You will also find links to my YouTube channels and blogs.

You can filter the projects by category or by technology. On the details page for each project you will find links to other stuff related to that particular project.

For continuous integration I'm using Github actions.
